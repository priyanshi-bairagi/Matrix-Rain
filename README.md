# Matrix-Rain
### About The Idea
Inspired from introduction part of a 1999 science fiction action film "The Matrix" written and directed by the Wachowskis.

The raining green code shown in the introduction is referred to as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_digital_rain">Matrix Rain</a>.

The symbols used in this rain are infact comprised largely of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana">Katakana</a>,which are characters that represent syllables in Japanese.
I have used <a href="https://unicode.org/standard/WhatIsUnicode.html">unicode</a> inorder to represent them. Here I have used all of the Katakana in <a href="https://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U30A0.pdf">Katakana Unicode Chart</a>(96 total). 
The code retrieves one of these beautiful symbols for every loop.


### My-Version
I have recreated this matrix rain in p5.js.
